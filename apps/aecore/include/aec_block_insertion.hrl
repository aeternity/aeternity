%%% Data structures used during block insertion - they should be used inside consesus modules
%%% and the consensus agnostic aec_chain_state module
%%%

%% Header along with it's hash
-record(node, { header :: aec_headers:header()
              , hash   :: binary()
              , type   :: key | micro
              }).

%% Metadata about the given fork
%% ForkId is local with regards to the node and for recently gossiped blocks
%% nodes might disagree about the exact value - fork_id is eventually consistent
%% across the network
-record(fork_info, { fork_id
                   , difficulty
                   , fees
                   , fraud
                   }).

%% Cache entry for recently inserted blocks
-record(recent_blocks, { key :: binary()
                       %% Window of recent statistics of the chain
                       %% The head of this list is always the node coresponding to the key

                       %% The remaining entries are {hash, term()}

                       %% The second element is defined by the currently active consensus engine
                       %% Please keep in mind that the cache is never filled by 2 engines at the same time
                       %% When a consensus change occurs the cache is regenerated

                       , len :: non_neg_integer()
                       }).

%% Insertion context - cached data used during block insertion
%% The data present in the context is sufficient for fully validating
%% the block headers outside a DB transaction.
