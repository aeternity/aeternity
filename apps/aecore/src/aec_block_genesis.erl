%%% @doc Genesis block definition.
%%%
%%% The genesis block does not follow the validation rules of the
%%% other blocks because:
%%% * Its state trees include preset accounts;
%%% * It does not contain a valid PoW (it is unmined);
%%%   * It implies genesis block cannot be validated PoW wise;
%%%   * Note: the miner account specified in the genesis block is
%%%     still rewarded as for the other blocks.
%%% * Its time is epoch i.e. much in the past;
%%%   * It implies the time difference between genesis block and first
%%%     block is very large - that may be considered abnormal for
%%%     successive blocks (e.g. between blocks 1 and 2 - with block 0
%%%     being genesis).
%%% * The value of the hash of the (nonexistent) previous block is
%%%   special i.e. all zeros.
%%%   * This means that validation function attempting to consider the
%%%     hashes in a block needs to have a special case for genesis.
