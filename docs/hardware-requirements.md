# Introduction

Hardware requirements may vary based in what mode the node is running, the network and it is supposed to run full sync or restore from database snapshot. Running a full node to do a full sync being the most resource intensive.
Requirements would also vary based on the node configuration, API requests and eventually on future consensus protocol and features.

## Summary

Running a full node with full since now and then (i.e. once per month):

- Intel(R) CPU 2 cores @ 3.0Ghz
- 8GB of RAM
- 500GB SSD storage
- 500GB bandwidth

## Processor

A recent generation of Intel(R) 2 CPU logical cores @ 2.5Ghz should cover normal operations.
However, during initial full sync the process is also CPU bound,
so more cores and higher frequency is recommended, for example 2 CPU cores @ 3.0GHz.

## Memory

It is recommended to use at least 8GB RAM.
However 4GB of RAM should be also good enough for modest cases.

## Storage

During initial full sync the node is very disk I/O intensive.
A disk with good I/O throughput is recommended in this case, that's usually a SSDs.
However, after the initial sync the node can run perfectly fine on a commodity HDDs.

### Full Node

Database size as of the moment of this writing is 270GB and grows with 13.5GB per month.
So a reasonable disk space allocation for 1 year horizon would be **450GB**.

### Lightweight Node

Database size as of the moment of this writing is 60GB and grows with 3GB per month.
So a reasonable disk space allocation for 1 year horizon would be **100GB**.

## Bandwidth

During the normal operations the node needs up to 30KB/s inbound and up to 30KB/s outbound traffic.
That's about 78GB/mo per direction or 156GB/mo total.

However during initial full sync this requirement goes as high as 1MB/s but 400KB/s on average inbound traffic.
