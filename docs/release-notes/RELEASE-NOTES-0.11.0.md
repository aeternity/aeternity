# About this release

[This release][this-release] is focused on support for hard forking.
It:
* Plants support for introducing backward incompatible changes to the consensus protocol (hard forking) without restarting the blockchain from genesis. This impacts the persisted DB;
* Adds a consistent serialization of P2P messages, using RLP in favor of MsgPack. This means that 0.11.0-nodes are not able to talk to nodes running older versions;
* Makes abilitation of HTTP API endpoints tagged as `debug` in the Swagger schema configurable;
* Enables configuration of empty set of initial peers to contact;
* Add configuration (`sync` > `listen_address`) to select which IP the sync service will listen to.
* Add configuration (`sync` > `external_port`) to support public sync port differing from the internal port.
* Improves the stability of the testnet.

[this-release]: https://github.com/aeternity/epoch/releases/tag/v0.11.0

This release introduce a new consensus protocol version at height 3750 while the genesis block is unchanged from the previous release "v0.10.1", therefore:
* Ensure you keep your account key pair: after upgrading your node, you shall have your previous balance as of approx. Thu 12 Apr 2018;
* Please ensure that you do not reuse a persisted blockchain produced by the previous releases "v0.10.x".
  * (Note for advanced users: this release *may* be able to start using a persisted blockchain produced by the previous release "v0.10.1" though this setup is not supported; this advanced information may be used for trustlessly seeding the lowest portion of a chain mined by the previous release into the peer-to-peer network of nodes running this release.)

Please join the testnet by following the instructions below, and let us know if you have any problems by [opening a ticket](https://github.com/aeternity/epoch/issues).
Troubleshooting of common issues is documented [in the wiki](https://github.com/aeternity/epoch/wiki/Troubleshooting).

The instructions below describe:
* [How to retrieve the released software for running a node](#retrieve-the-software-for-running-a-node);
* [How to install a node](#install-node);
* [How to join the testnet](#join-the-testnet).

## Retrieve the software for running a node

You can run a node by using either:
* The published [release binary][this-release] corresponding to your platform; or
* The published [Docker image `aeternity/epoch`][docker].

[docker]: https://github.com/aeternity/epoch/blob/v0.11.0/docs/docker.md

The user configuration is documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/aeternity/epoch/wiki/User-provided-configuration).
For specifying configuration using the Docker image, please refer to [its documentation][docker].

The node user API is documented:
* HTTP API endpoints are specified [online in swagger.yaml][swagger-yaml];
  * A JSON version of same specification is located in the node at path `lib/aehttp-0.1.0/priv/swagger.json`;
  * An interactive visualization of the same specification is available [online][swagger-ui].
* WebSocket API endpoints are [specified online][api-doc];
* The intended usage of the user API (HTTP and WebSocket) is [documented online][api-doc].

## Install node

The instructions for installing a node using a release binary are in [the dedicated separate document](../../docs/installation.md).

For installation of a node using the Docker image, please refer to [its documentation online][docker].

## Join the testnet

This section describes how to run a node as part of the testnet - the public test network of nodes - by using the release binary.

For running a node as part of the testnet by using the Docker image, please consult [its documentation][docker] in addition to this section.

### Inspect the testnet

The core nodes of the public test network are accessible from the Internet.

Information, e.g. height, of the top block of the longest chain as seen by these core nodes of the testnet can be obtained by opening in the browser any of the following URLs:
* http://52.10.46.160:3013/v2/top
* http://18.195.109.60:3013/v2/top
* http://13.250.162.250:3013/v2/top
* http://31.13.249.70:3013/v2/top

### Setup your node

Setting up your node consists of:
* Configuring your node - see instructions in [the dedicated separate document](../../docs/configuration.md);
* Starting your node and verifying it works as expected - see instructions in [the dedicated separate document](../../docs/operation.md).
