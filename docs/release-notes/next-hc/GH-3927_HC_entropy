* Introduces a new consensus model for HyperChains. This is where we will keep
  HyperChains specifics. Some parts of the consensus are stubbed as they are
  still in work in progress state. It can be activated by setting the config
  value for the appropriate height to have a `name` being `hyper_chain`. This
  is added to the handful of existing different consensuses to chose from,
  most interesting of which are:
    * `pow_cuckoo` for PoW as it is currently on mainnet
    * `smart_contract` for a pure PoS consensus, driven by a smart contract
* AE parent connector is being refactored, now its settings are exposed to the
  config - parent chain nodes and a fetch interval in milliseconds
* Parent chain cache - we cache parent chain headers in order to speed up the
   child's syncing. It has the following configs:
   * a number of confirmations before a parent chain block is considered to be
     finalized. This impacts consensus
   * parent chain start height - the height of the parent chain that
     corresponds to the child's genesis block. This is also impacting
     consensus
* The consensus contract is being reworked - now the responsibilites for DPoS
  and leader election are split into two contracts. This makes it easier to
  reuse DPoS while changing the election and vice versa
* Parent chain block hash is being propagated to the election smart contract.
  It is being used during the election as a source of entropy.
* Genesis seed files are generated and not being included in releases.
* Seed files are loaded according to the network id. This makes it easier to
  setup different HyperChains.
