* The process that handles the state for the State Channel client in the node
  has a list of different timeouts. They define different time frames for
  certain events to be completed. Running out of time is a violation of the
  off-chain protocol so if it happens - the connection is closed and it is up
  to the State Channel client how to proceed next. This enhances user
  experience adding a new info message for the timeouts.
