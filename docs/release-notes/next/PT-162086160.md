* Changes behaviour of Name Claim, State Channels Close Mutual and State
  Channels Settle transactions so that they do not burn tokens, and send tokens
  to a special account without private key access instead. This affects
  consensus.
* Changes behaviour in miner reward distribution: when a proof of fraud is
  received - the fraudelent does not receive any reward and the poster of the
  proof of fraud gets a fraction of it. In order for this not to skew the
  inflation, excess tokens are sent to a special account without private key
  access instead. This affects consensus.
