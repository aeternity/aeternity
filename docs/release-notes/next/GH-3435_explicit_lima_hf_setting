* Adds an explicit settings for `local_lima_testnet`. So far those were
  implicit as Lima is the currently running release. The MDW though uses a
  macro to parse those and if there is no explicit function head - it fails.
  This aims at providing the MDW with capabilities to work with a local Lima
  test environment.
