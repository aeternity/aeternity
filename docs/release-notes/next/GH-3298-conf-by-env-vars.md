* Configuration values can now be set using OS environment variables, where the environment variable name is on the form `AE__k1__k2`, e.g. `AE__CHAIN__PERSIST=true`. Note that two underscores are used to separate each level. Structured values must be JSON-encoded. The prefix `AE` can not be customized. The environment variables are applied after reading an available config file, and all values are checked against the schema. See `docs/configuration.md`.
