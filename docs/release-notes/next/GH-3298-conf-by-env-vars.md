* Configuration values can now be set using OS environment variables, where the environment variable name is on the form `AECONF__k1__k2`, e.g. `AECONF__chain__persist=true`. Note that two underscores are used to separate each level. Currently, array types are not handled, and the prefix `AECONF` can not be customized. The environment variables are applied after reading an available config file, and all values are checked against the schema.
