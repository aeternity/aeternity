* Introduces a new HTTP API for asking the node to provide a correct
  `paying_for_tx`. It is marked as `debug` and it is intended to be used while
  developing tools that produce that transaction. This API must not be used in
  real-life scenarios. Since the inner transaction has a specific
  `network_id`, a proper check has been added to the API so attempts to create
  an erronous `paying_for_tx` will fail.
