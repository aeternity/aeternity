# About this release

[This][this-release] is a maintenance release.
It:
* Ensures that synchronous jsonrpc calls to asynchronous methods get an "ok" response instead of timing out.
* Fine-tunes error handling of slash and settle in the WebSocket channels API.
* Automatically configures testnet seed peers and BRI beneficiary accounts based on network_id configuration.
* Enables configuring the network in the console by passing `-network_id` argument i.e. `bin/aeternity start -network_id ae_uat`.
* Adds public peer key to status API endpoint.
* Adds top block height and top key block hash to status API endpoint.

[this-release]: https://github.com/aeternity/aeternity/releases/tag/v3.2.0

This release is backward compatible with previous `v3.1.*` and `v3.0.1` releases.

Please join the mainnet by following the instructions below, and let us know if you have any problems by [opening a ticket](https://github.com/aeternity/aeternity/issues).
Troubleshooting of common issues is documented [in the wiki](https://github.com/aeternity/aeternity/wiki/Troubleshooting).

The instructions below describe:
* [How to retrieve the released software for running a node](#retrieve-the-software-for-running-a-node);
* [How to install a node](#install-node);
* [How to join the mainnet](#join-the-mainnet).
* [How to join the testnet](#join-the-testnet).

## Retrieve the software for running a node

You can run a node by either:
* Installing the published [release binary][this-release] corresponding to your platform; or
* Running the published [Docker image `aeternity/aeternity`][docker]; or
* [Building a release binary from source][build].

[docker]: https://github.com/aeternity/aeternity/blob/v3.2.0/docs/docker.md
[build]: https://github.com/aeternity/aeternity/blob/v3.2.0/docs/build.md

The instructions for configuring the node using the Docker image are in [the dedicated separate document][docker].

The node user API is documented:
* HTTP API endpoints are specified [online in swagger.yaml][swagger-yaml];
  * A JSON version of the same specification is located in the node at path `lib/aehttp-*/priv/swagger.json` (you will need to amend the wildcard `*` placeholder in the path with the version).
  * The JSON version can be obtained from a running node using the endpoint `/api`.
  * An interactive visualization of the same specification is available [online][swagger-ui].
* WebSocket API endpoints are [specified online][api-doc];
* The intended usage of the user API (HTTP and WebSocket) is [documented online][api-doc].

[swagger-yaml]: https://github.com/aeternity/aeternity/blob/v3.2.0/config/swagger.yaml
[swagger-ui]: https://aeternity.github.io/api-docs/?config=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aeternity/aeternity/v3.2.0/apps/aehttp/priv/swagger.json
[api-doc]: https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/aeternity-node-v3.2.0/node/api/README.md

## Install node

The instructions for installing a node using a release binary are in [the dedicated separate document](../../docs/installation.md).

For installation of a node using the Docker image, please refer to the [documentation online][docker].

## Join the mainnet

In order to join the mainnet follow the [operation instructions](../../docs/operation.md) to run the node with default configuration as mainnet is the default network.

To join the mainnet by using the Docker image, please refer to [docker documentation][docker].

### Mainnet seed nodes

The release package comes preconfigured with seed nodes. Here is example subset of the seed nodes:

### Inspect the mainnet

Here are example nodes that can be used to inspect current top block and see information about e.g. height or target:

* http://18.136.37.63:3013/v2/blocks/top
* http://52.220.198.72:3013/v2/blocks/top
* http://13.53.114.199:3013/v2/blocks/top
* http://13.53.149.181:3013/v2/blocks/top

## Join the testnet

In order to join the testnet change the [Network ID](../../docs/configuration.md#network-id) in node configuration file to `ae_uat`.

To join the testnet by using the Docker image, please refer to the [docker documentation][docker].

### Testnet seed nodes

The release package comes preconfigured with testnet seed nodes, this is the list:

* aenode://pp_QU9CvhAQH56a2kA15tCnWPRJ2srMJW8ZmfbbFTAy7eG4o16Bf@52.10.46.160:3015

* aenode://pp_DMLqy7Zuhoxe2FzpydyQTgwCJ52wouzxtHWsPGo51XDcxc5c8@13.53.161.215:3015

### Inspect the testnet

The core nodes of the public test network are accessible from the Internet.

Information, e.g. height, of the top block of the longest chain as seen by these core nodes of the testnet can be obtained by opening in the browser any of the following URLs:
* http://52.10.46.160:3013/v2/blocks/top
* http://18.195.109.60:3013/v2/blocks/top
* http://13.250.162.250:3013/v2/blocks/top
* http://13.53.161.215:3013/v2/blocks/top

### Setup your node

Setting up your node consists of:
* Configuring your node - see instructions in [the dedicated separate document](../../docs/configuration.md);
* Starting your node and verifying it works as expected - see instructions in [the dedicated separate document](../../docs/operation.md).
