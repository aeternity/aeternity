We keep our protocol, APIs and research spec in separate [protocol](https://github.com/aeternity/protocol) repository
* [Overview of the APIs](https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/master/epoch/api/README.md#overview)
* [Intended usage of the user API](https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/master/epoch/api/README.md#user-api---intended-usage)

How to start?
