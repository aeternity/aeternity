# How to start

We [publish packages][releases] for major platforms on GitHub.
Each release comes with [release notes][release-notes] describing the
changes of the Aeternity node in each particular version.

Please use the [latest published stable release][latest-release] rather than the [`master` branch][master].
The `master` branch tracks the ongoing efforts towards the next stable release to be published though it is not guaranteed to be stable.
