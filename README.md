# How to start

We [publish packages][releases] for major platforms on GitHub.
Each release comes with [release notes][release-notes] describing the
installation and configuration instructions of the Aeternity node.

Below is an overview of the installation process for different platforms,
building the package from source, configuration and operation of the Aeternity
node.
